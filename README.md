# Nsumo
This repository tracks the code of Nsumo (500g 10x10cm Sumobot) as I re-write it
from scratch and show the complete process in a [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9KbXJydf8I&t=1s).
It's a work in progress! You find the original code [here](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_software.git) and
the hardware design [here](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_hardware.git).
